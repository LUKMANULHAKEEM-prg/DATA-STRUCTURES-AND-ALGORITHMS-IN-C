# Beginner-Friendly Data Structures and Algorithms in C

Welcome to the Beginner-Friendly Data Structures and Algorithms repository in C! This repository is designed to provide beginners with a structured and accessible introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms using the C programming language.

## About

This repository aims to:

- Provide clear explanations and implementations of essential data structures and algorithms.
- Cater to beginners by maintaining simplicity and clarity in code and explanations.
- Foster a supportive learning environment where beginners can grasp concepts at their own pace.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: This directory contains implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

- **Algorithms**: Here, you'll find implementations of common algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.
